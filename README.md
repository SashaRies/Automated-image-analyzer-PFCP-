This repository contains all resources related to my automation project for analyzing images taken during Polymer Fatigue Crack Propagation tests. The goal of this project is to streamline and automate the image processing workflow, letting material science researchers quickly analyze polymer characteristics

***analysis_automated.py is the main file***


Key Features:

Automated Image Processing: Scripts and tools to process images of polymer samples, detect crack growth, and extract key metrics.

Data Analysis: Automated extraction of crack propagation data and visualization tools for fatigue analysis.

Image Segmentation & Detection: Algorithms for identifying crack initiation points and tracking the progression of cracks.

Sample images and output folder: Folders with sample images and folders in which analyzed/labeled images go  for further manual analysis
